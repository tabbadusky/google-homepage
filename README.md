My first repository on Github!  This is called "Project HTML/CSS," which can be found at:
http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav

The Odin Project ("Web Development 101") has been fun and informative.  I highly recommend it and, as I get further into the curriculum, the more I want to "get my hands dirty" building something useful and elegant.

I love :coffee: and :pizza: too!
